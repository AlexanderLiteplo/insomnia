# Orchestrator

The Worker/Manager system that autonomously builds projects using Claude.

## Overview

The orchestrator uses a two-agent architecture:
- **Worker** (Opus): Implements tasks, runs tests, marks tasks as done when passing
- **Manager** (Opus): Reviews completed work, approves or requests changes, generates skills

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check status
./scripts/orchestrator.sh status

# Start the orchestrator
./scripts/orchestrator.sh start

# Stop the orchestrator
./scripts/orchestrator.sh stop

# View logs
./scripts/orchestrator.sh logs
```

## Creating a Project

1. Create a `prds/tasks.json` file (see `prds/tasks.example.json` for format)
2. Start the orchestrator: `./scripts/orchestrator.sh start`
3. The Worker will pick up tasks and begin implementation

## Task Lifecycle

```
pending → in_progress → worker_done → completed
                ↑             │
                └─────────────┘
              (if changes requested)
```

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `orchestrator.sh` | Start/stop/status/logs for the orchestrator |
| `projects.sh` | Manage multiple projects |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ORCHESTRATOR_DIR` | Path to orchestrator directory | Auto-detected |

## Skills System

As the Manager reviews completed work, it extracts reusable patterns into skill files.
See `skills/README.md` for details.
