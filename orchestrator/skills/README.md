# Skills

Skills are reusable knowledge files generated by the Manager agent during code reviews.

## How Skills Work

1. When the Manager reviews completed work, it identifies patterns and learnings
2. These learnings are saved as `.md` files in this directory
3. Future Workers can reference these skills when working on similar tasks

## Skill Format

Each skill file should contain:
- **Context**: When to apply this skill
- **Problem**: What issue or pattern it addresses
- **Solution**: The recommended approach
- **Example**: Code or configuration examples

## Example Skill

```markdown
# Error Handling in API Routes

## Context
When building API endpoints that interact with external services.

## Problem
Unhandled errors can crash the server or leak sensitive information.

## Solution
Always wrap external calls in try-catch blocks and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Example
\`\`\`typescript
try {
  const result = await externalService.call();
  return Response.json(result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('External service error:', error);
  return Response.json({ error: 'Service unavailable' }, { status: 503 });
}
\`\`\`
```

## Managing Skills

Skills accumulate over time as the system learns from completed projects. You can:
- Review and edit skills manually
- Delete outdated skills
- Organize skills into subdirectories by topic
