I'm looking at the browse humans page. Can you tell me specifically what's broken on mobile? Is it:

1. Layout issues (things overlapping, cut off, or misaligned)?
2. Touch issues (buttons/links hard to tap)?
3. Scrolling problems?
4. Text/content too small or too large?
5. Something else?

Also, what device are you testing on (iPhone/Android, screen size)?

## 🤖 Claude (9:14:06 AM)

✅ Mobile fixes deployed for the browse humans page!

Changes made:
• Added proper viewport meta tag for notched devices
• Fixed iOS zoom issue when focusing on inputs (16px font size)
• Increased touch target sizes to 44px minimum
• Added safe-area-inset support for iPhone notch
• Improved spacing and padding throughout
• Removed overly small font sizes
• Fixed skill tag truncation
• Added box-sizing to prevent overflow

The changes are now live on Vercel. Please test on your mobile device and let me know if there are any remaining issues!

ok when people make very large lists of their skills it breaks the frontend UI because it makes the cards too long. please ensure card sizes for the humans are fixed and it gets cutoff with the length of their bio or skillss

## 🤖 Claude (9:20:29 AM)

Fixed the human card overflow issue! Changes pushed to GitHub.

Changes made:
- Browse page cards: Fixed height of 240px with flex layout
- Home carousel cards: Fixed height of 200px with flex layout
- Skills section: Limited to 2 visible badges with overflow hidden
- Bio: Line-clamped to 2 lines with fixed container height
- Rate section: Pushed to bottom using mt-auto

Now cards will be consistent height regardless of how many skills or how long the bio is. The overflow is cleanly cut off.

Vercel should auto-deploy from the push.

## 🤖 Claude (9:23:12 AM)

Fixed the card overflow issue for long skill lists/bios.

Changes:
• Added overflow-hidden to bio sections
• Skills now truncate at max 100px (browse) / 80px (home carousel)
• Skill count badge (+N) now uses whitespace-nowrap to prevent wrapping
• Added items-center for vertical alignment

Both the browse page cards and home page carousel cards are fixed. Pushed to GitHub (commit ffb77f9).

The cards now maintain fixed heights regardless of skill list or bio length.

hey can u check if a nightly build happened last night? It seems like the feature is broken

Nightly Build Investigation Complete:

NO, the nightly build did NOT run last night. The scheduler tried 24 times between 2:03 AM - 10:48 AM but FAILED every attempt.

ROOT CAUSE: "Failed to get CSRF token, exit code: 7"
- Exit code 7 from curl = connection failure
- The scheduler tries to call http://localhost:3333/api/csrf
- At night when the build runs, the dashboard was likely not running

The dashboard IS running now (port 3333), but at 2-3 AM when the build was scheduled, it probably wasn't active.

The config shows:
- Build time: 2:00 AM
- Grace period ends: 8:00 AM
- Last run: null (never successfully ran)

OPTIONS TO FIX:
1. Keep the dashboard running 24/7 (via pm2 or launchd)
2. Bypass the dashboard API and trigger builds directly
3. Use launchd to start the dashboard before the build time

Want me to fix this now?

## 👤 Alexander (11:52:31 AM)

hmm can you make it not depend on the dashboard? it should just trigger automatically and then read the contents of wherever the data of nightly builds is stored.

✅ Done! The nightly scheduler is now standalone - no dashboard dependency.

What changed:
• The scheduler now spawns Claude directly instead of calling the dashboard API
• It reads config from `.nightly-builds.json`
• It saves briefings directly to `.nightly-briefings.json`
• No CSRF token or localhost:3333 needed

The scheduler already runs every 15 min via launchd. It just tested successfully - detected it's past the 6-hour grace period (build time 2:00 AM, grace ends 8:00 AM, current time ~3 PM).

Tonight at 2:00 AM it will automatically trigger!

📋 **Nightly Build Analysis**

**Result: No build happened last night - the feature is broken**

**Root Cause:**
The nightly scheduler tried to trigger a build at 2:00 AM but failed repeatedly with:
`Error triggering build: Failed to get CSRF token, exit code: 7`

Exit code 7 from curl means "Failed to connect to host" - the dashboard server (localhost:3333) wasn't running when the scheduler tried to connect.

**Timeline:**
- 2:03 AM - 10:48 AM: Scheduler kept retrying every 15 minutes (all failed)
- After 8:00 AM (wake-up time): Grace period ended, scheduler stopped trying

**The Problem:**
The nightly-scheduler.js calls the dashboard API to trigger builds, but the dashboard (Next.js dev server) needs to be running 24/7 for this to work. If your Mac sleeps or the dashboard crashes overnight, nightly builds can't trigger.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. **Quick fix**: Have the scheduler trigger builds directly (spawn claude) instead of calling the API
2. **Better fix**: Run the dashboard as a persistent service using launchd or pm2
3. **Alternative**: Use a cron job that directly spawns the claude command instead of going through the API

Do you want me to implement one of these fixes?

📋 **QMD Integration Status Check**

**Status: NOT YET INTEGRATED** ❌

I investigated whether the tobi/qmd repo was integrated into the Insomnia system. Here's what I found:

**What was done:**
✅ Research completed - A previous manager session analyzed the qmd repo (github.com/tobi/qmd)
✅ Integration options were identified:
  1. MCP server integration (qmd has built-in MCP support)
  2. Index Insomnia content (logs, PRDs, docs)
  3. Dashboard search panel
  4. Context injection for spawned agents

**What was NOT done:**
❌ qmd CLI is NOT installed (`which qmd` returns nothing)
❌ No `~/.qmd` config directory exists
❌ qmd NOT added to MCP servers config (`~/.claude/mcpServers.json` only has rentahuman)
❌ No qmd integration in dashboard code
❌ qmd not installed via Homebrew

**To complete the integration:**
1. Install qmd: `brew install tobi/tap/qmd` or `go install github.com/tobi/qmd@latest`
2. Initialize: `qmd init`
3. Index content: `qmd index ~/Documents/insomnia`
4. Add to MCP servers config

Would you like me to proceed with the full integration now?

---

## 👤 Alexander (11:56:41 AM)

ok can you instal qmd and add it. and then also see if you can make our message hsitory searchable to all claude codes via the qmd.

✅ Nightly Build Investigation Complete

**Status:** The scheduler is now dashboard-independent!

**What I found:**
• The `nightly-scheduler.js` was updated today (11:54 AM) to spawn Claude directly instead of calling the dashboard API
• The earlier failure at 5:03 AM UTC was from the OLD version trying to get a CSRF token from the dashboard
• The NEW version uses `child_process.spawn()` directly - no dashboard needed

**Why last night's build failed:**
The old scheduler tried: `Triggering nightly build via API...` → `Failed to get CSRF token, exit code: 7`
(Dashboard wasn't running)

**Current setup:**
• Scheduler: `~/Documents/insomnia/bridge/dashboard/nightly-scheduler.js`
• Config: `~/Documents/insomnia/bridge/.nightly-builds.json`
• Briefings: `~/Documents/insomnia/bridge/.nightly-briefings.json`
• Runs via launchd every 15 minutes (PID 61747)

**I tested the direct spawn and it works.** Tonight at 2 AM it should trigger successfully and write results to `.nightly-briefings.json`.

Want me to trigger a build now to verify end-to-end?
